# MC6809 Tools

This is a machine code emulator for the MC6809, along with assemblers, tests and other support tools. My goal is to run it on Mac and ESP8266/ESP32. It will not only simulate the 6809, but an entire SBC, including RAM, a ROM monitor and various simulated peripherals.

There are several 6809 single board computers available and plenty of emulators, assemblers and other tools available. I'm writing an emulator completely from scratch both to enjoy the process and to make it easy to run it on a variety of platforms. Running on a Mac will allow me to test and debug the emulator as well as 6809 code written for it.
